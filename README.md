# i3_arch
i3 is a tiling window manager, completely written from scratch. The target platforms are GNU/Linux and BSD operating systems, our code is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) under the BSD license. i3 is primarily targeted at advanced users and developers..

One of the nicest things about Linux (and open source software in general) is the freedom to choose among different alternatives to address our needs.

I've been using Linux for a long time, but I was never entirely happy with the desktop environment options available. Until recently, Xfce was my go-to desktop environment; good compromise between features and performance. Then I found i3, an amazing piece of software. A tiling window manager automatically arranges the windows to occupy the whole screen in a non-overlapping way.

I3 is fast. It is neither bloated nor fancy. It is designed to be simple and efficient. As a developer, I value these features, as I can use the extra capacity to power my favorite development tools or test stuff locally using containers or virtual machines.
